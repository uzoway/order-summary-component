## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/) - SASS 

### What I learned

During the course of completing this project, I improved my Frontend coding skills and also improved on new concepts I'm picking up lately like writing media queries in SASS and using the mobile first design approach in building a website.

### Continued development

Going forward, I'll be building my next couple of projects using the mobile first design approach and SASS for styling.

### Useful resources

- [Approaches to Media Queries in Sass](https://css-tricks.com/approaches-media-queries-sass/) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand writing media queries in SASS. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
